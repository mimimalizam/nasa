## Simple Slack Bot - NASA

It uses NASA API [APOD].

### Commands

![commands](public/commands.png)

### Development

Bot was created by following Slack's tutorial for [making bots with Ruby](https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-bot/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md "Slack-Ruby-Bot Tutorial").

### Running a bot locally

```bash
foreman start
```

### Deploying bot to Heroku

- [ToDo] Configure Heroku toolbelt locally
- From the comfort of your terminal create new app on Heroku

    ```bash
    heroku create <app-name>
    ```
- Add environment variables to this app with commands similar to the following.
We'd like to execute this for every variable listed in our `.env` file.

    ```bash
    heroku config:add ENV_VAR_NAME=<its-value>
    ```

- Deploy it by running the following command locally

    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

### Set up an automatic deployment on Semaphore

If we set up [Semaphore server] for the master branch,
our application will automatically be deployed to Heroku after every green build on master.

### Wake up Dyno with an outgoing webhook in Slack

Every app deployd to Heroku gets few [Heroku Dyno]s, lightweight containers.
When app is using Heroku free tier it gets very tired Dyno, which goes to sleep after 30 mins of inactivity.

To entertain a Dyno, I'e set up one [Outgoing WebHook] for Slack. Let's call it `Houston`.
When mentioned, `Houston` pings my Heroku application.
So, at the moment, `Houston` listens for triggers in Slack chat messages.
When a trigger word (`Houston`) is noticed, Slack will send relevant data to external URL(s) in real-time.

#### Configure webhook

To wake up the application, I've decided to create an [Outgoing WebHook].
In order to achive that,  I've:

- filled the URL box with the URL of deployed application on Heroku
`https://nasa-apod-bot.herokuapp.com/houston`
- specified trigger word `houston`

When `nasa` is inactive on Slack it will ignore every picture request.
Then I just type `houston` :)

On a side note, this page lets us to customize some webhook's details
(e.g. `Name`, `Icon`, select `Slack channel(s)`)

#### Verify if request is known

Webhook page from above also shows the `token` which is included in every outgoing playload.
This lets me to verify that a post request came from my Slack team.
At the momment, logic for this lives in the `web.rb` file.

```ruby
return if params[:token] != ENV["SLACK_WEBHOOK_TOKEN"]
```

### Trivia

> Houston, we've had a problem.

Sentence coined by NASA astronaut [Jack Swigert](https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/swigert-jl.html),
best known as the command module pilot aboard [Apollo 13](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-350/ch-13-1.html).
